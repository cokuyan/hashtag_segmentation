# hashtag_segmentation

This repo contains my implementation for the hashtag segmentation coding challenge from nwo.ai.

The main code is found in `segment_string.py` and the companion word frequencies are found in word_freq.csv, which was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency
